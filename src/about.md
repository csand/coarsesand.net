## Good Evening

Or whatever time of day it is where you are now, and welcome to my site. You're
here to click something on the left I expect, and won't bother to read the rest
of this. Well, good on you, I'll probably be hearing from you momentarily.

If, however, you have no idea why you're here, and think it would generally be
a good idea for you to continue reading this page, you probably want to know
who I am. I'm Sam Anderson, a web developer from Ottawa, Canada. I love
JavaScript, Python and Ruby, and creating things that go on the internet with
them. I'm a [VIM][] addict, seem to be learning something new about [zsh][]
every day, and generally like to tinker a bit too much.
